<h1>How to style HTML</h1>
<p>
    Formatting HTML is simple. You can use ?p? to create paragraphs
    or ?br? to break lines within a single paragraph. You can use
    ?b? or ?strong? to make texts <!-- make bold -->bold, as well as
    you can use ?i? or ?em? to make texts <!-- make italic -->italic.
</p>
<p>
    You can also mix these tags to make text
    <!-- make bold italic -->bold italic. Another option is to use the
    ?span? tag to assign custom styling to a block of text.
    For example, the text can be
    <!-- make underlined -->underlined
    or have <!-- change color to white on black background-->different color.
</p>
